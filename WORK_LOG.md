| 2/25 | 10:45-11:55 | I was introduced to this problem set and did a lot of thinking about it, specifically first thinking recursively and then moving to a tabulation algorithm. We decided to go from top left corner and fill 2D array all the way down. |
| 2/27 |  8:45-9:25  |                                                                                                                                 I was able to code the algorithm and it worked! I will now work on finding what the actual string is. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
